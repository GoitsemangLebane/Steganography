Steganography is the study, application and  practise of concealing information within objects such as any image files in such a way that it deceives the viewer as if there is no information hidden  within the object.

This software I created can be used to hide any sensitive information within any image file such as a holiday picture or a wedding anniversary picture. The hidden files that can be supported for this software is only text(.txt)-for now!-The hidden files have multiple layers of encryption and it would not be practical  for anyone to try and decrypt it, well if they do come up with the idea thatc a certain picture is hidding some certain information as the file created after hiding the data will be displayed as an image

The software was builty on PyCharm using Python programming language
Used Tkinter and its library toolkits for the GUI interface
used auto-py-to-exe to convert my .py program into an executable .exe file with a graphical interface as means so that my software can be downloaded and be run on any machine, even if iot does not have Python installed or any platform that executes python scripts.
